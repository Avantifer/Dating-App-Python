Unlike sites like Bumble, Secret Love doesn't filter based on height, education, race, or religion because demographics do not define a person. We believe everyone deserves the right to be seen and make the first move no matter how they identify. On our app, we put everyone in front of you and let you choose who you want to chat with."
